# LittleShopOfTrees
A place where you can find the best deals for trees. Made as a lab project.
The goals was to learn css and html.The project should inclue one product page,
one start page, and one about us page. I did inclue some extra pages just because I really
enjoyed the project. https://carpenteri1.github.io/LittleShopOfTrees/startPage.html
